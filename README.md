# Pok√©mon Damage Calculator (Telegram Bot)

This bot was made by me to learn something out of Python. 

* To report a bug please open an [issue](https://github.com/Simone-Alghisi/Pkmn-dmg-calc-bot/issues/new).

* To improve how the bot works please consider opening a [pull request](https://github.com/Simone-Alghisi/Pkmn-dmg-calc-bot/pulls) before developing an identical application.

The bot uses the code made available by Smogon to calculate the damage (if you are interested you can find it [here](https://github.com/smogon/damage-calc)).

## Q&A

### Q: How can I notify a bug?

A: Please open an issue to notify a bug. In the issue, it would be great if you could also specify what you were doing: e.g. *I was trying to pick a nature*, *I selected the Life Orb*, ... I know: I'm asking a lot out from you ;-)

### Q: Why you've created the bot?

A: The original idea was to learn to code in Python before my traineeship. Given that, and also due to my hobby regarding VGC, I've decided to create a Telegram Bot in Python to calculate the damage dealt/taken (just like other online damage calculators).

### Q: Can I use it?

A: Of course, you are free to use it and you can find it [here](https://t.me/Pokemon_D_C_bot).

### Q: Can I edit the code?

A: This code is free to use, however I would appreciate if you could contribute to the project and improve the bot.

### Q: Why some resources in the config folder are not available?

A: I didn't know if I could upload them on GitHub.

### Q: WTF! I can't understand the code at all!

A: Firstly, this is not a question but never mind. Secondly, me too my friend! Jokes aside: as I've said before, this project is just for fun and nothing more. I'm perfectly conscious that I could have written the code in a better way, however, I didn't have the time to go back to this project once my traineeship started.
